### What is the problem you plan to solve/measure?

The problem we are trying to solve is to use ML algorithms(NN) to solve the problem of choosing harmonious color pattern (by taking advantage of pre-ranked(trained) color palettes) for an object of given color scheme/palette. 

The use cases for the problem are many-
- Ability to choose the article with matching color while buying personal accessories both online and offline. 
- Assisting users with color blindness to effectively make choice of accessory purchase decisions based on the application.
- Enabling users to make smart decisions by recommending them the list of colors that is essential for them based on their tagging of existing wardrobe colors.
- < â€¦ more use cases will be explored and added >

> __Future work:__ The high level approach can be further extended to the Augmented Reality world, by showing the changed scenes at real time to the user.


</br>
_The tentative timelines are as follows (high level task breakdown) -_
</br> 
1) __February- Mid March__ - Setting up the basic client and server for the application. Training data dump. Getting the MVP up.
2) __Second half of March - Mid April__ - Testing the application to accommodate different use cases. Hyperparameter tuning on the discriminative network to get better matches. 
3) __April- Deadline__ - Performance analysis for different network modes(LTE,WiFi), energy computation and GPU usage optimization and hyperparameter tuning for the purpose. Final report compilation with test cases.
