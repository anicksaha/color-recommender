### Overview ~

The problem we are solving(at least trying to) is to use ML algorithms(NN) to solve the problem of choosing harmonious color pattern (by taking advantage of pre-ranked(trained) color palettes) for an object of given color scheme/palette. 

Some of the many use cases are -
- Ability to choose the article with matching color while buying personal accessories both online and offline. 
- Assisting users with color blindness to effectively make choice of accessory purchase decisions based on the application.
- Enabling users to make smart decisions by recommending them the list of colors that is essential for them based on their tagging of existing wardrobe colors.
- < â€¦ more use cases will be explored and added >

> __Future work:__ The high level approach can be further extended to the Augmented Reality world, by showing the changed scenes at real time to the user.
